    "\n",
    "1. **HTTP** is a request/response protocol on top of TCP. Headers, status codes, and methods (GET/POST) are all human-readable ASCII.\n",
    "2. **Conditional GETs** and **web caches** save bandwidth and reduce latency.\n",
    "3. **DNS** is a distributed, hierarchical system. Caching at the local DNS server dramatically speeds up repeated lookups.\n",
    "4. **UDP sockets** require destination addresses on every send; **TCP sockets** establish a connection first, then send/receive without specifying addresses.\n",
    "5. **Persistent HTTP** saves significant time over non-persistent by reusing TCP connections.\n",
